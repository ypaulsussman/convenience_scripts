## Seeker

Magnifying Glass: Staple. This is maybe the best value that you can get for just 1 resource. It doesn’t even cost an action. You just show up with this card in hand, slap it on the table and enjoy being more competent at seeking now. Hell, you might even want to throw down two of these.
Old Book of Lore: Alright, so this is where we need to talk about Daisy. Daisy is amazing, her ability to use a book ability for free each turn is incredible. But it warps the perception we get of every tome to the point where we pretty much need to look at it twice. Once for Daisy. And once for everyone else. Old Book of Lore is especially relevant for this distinction because it can pretty much be considered Daisy’s actual signature. Like… if you play Daisy, you play OBoL. Staple. Just always. No exceptions. Getting to plow through your deck every turn without an action is absolutely amazing and the backbone of why Daisy is so powerful. Old Book of Lore is still Good to Excellent for non-Daisy investigators though. Taking an action to draw a card is something that comes up from time to time and OBoL pretty much enhances this basic action to draw 1 out of 3 instead of just the top card. Most investigators would want this effect, but the hand slot is the limiting factor. As an example, if you are Roland you would probably want a Mag Glass and a Machete or pistol instead.
Research Librarian: Excellent. Searching your whole deck for a thing is very good. Research Librarian basically acts as extra copies of your Tome cards as long as you have a free ally slot and 2 extra resources for it (although it should be said that a certain event from Dream-Eaters makes sure you don’t have to pay the 2). These limitations keep it from being a staple, as your ally slot as a seeker is usually spoken for by someone we are going to talk about very soon.
Medical Text: Bad. This is just First Aid again, except even worse. While this doesn’t have limited uses, it can’t heal horror. And healing damage even requires a test which makes you deal extra damage instead if you fail. Absolutely horrible. Even with Daisy’s free action, this is just awful.
Dr. Milan Christopher: Staple. This is the reason the seeker ally slot is spoken for. Milan is a class-defining staple card, even more so than Beat Cop. He gives seekers that all important +1 intellect value while also fixing their resources. He costs 4 upfront, but will quickly pay for himself and then start to generate lots and lots of value. This card is fantastic and even in a full card pool has very little competition (although it has gotten some recently).
Hyperawareness: Okay. Actually decent. When compared to Guardians, Seekers tend to have a bit more in terms of spare resources (often thanks to Milan). This allows them to invest into important investigations with this. It also gives them a way to emergency evade something they can’t deal with otherwise. Drops off massively in value with a more opened up card pool.
Barricade: Bad. A very situational card that has a hard time ever mattering. There are some niche meme things that can be done with it on a full card pool, but in the Core this is near-worthless.
Mind over Matter: Excellent. Doesn’t look like much, but is actually very potent. While this can not be played in the Mythos phase, this is still a lifesaver that handles a lot of different challenges. Maybe the most important one during Night of the Zealot is that this allows Daisy to discard a Locked Door treachery that is blocking her from progressing.
Working a Hunch: Okay. Like Evidence earlier, this is one of those cards that trades for a clue. No condition this time, but it costs 2 resources which is rough. I don’t like playing it, but on a smaller card pool it does its job and it at least comes with good icons when you don’t want to spend the resources on it.
Disc of Itzamna: Okay. Seekers are bad at handling enemies, so this does fill a niche. It is very expensive though and needs to be played upfront. It does its job, but i am usually not happy about having to play it. Later sets give it some extra legs through its Relic trait and the possibility for easier recursion.
Deduction: Staple. Again, a card for a clue. But what sets Deduction apart is that it doesn’t cost you anything. It even brings an icon to your test, making your other clue more likely. It’s drawback of course is that the test could fail, but as a Seeker you have your ways to make that as unlikely as possible.
Magnifying Glass(1xp): Good. A very cheap upgrade. The cost is reduced by 1, all the way down to zero. Can’t really beat that cost. The ability to return the Mag Glass to your hand allows for freeing up a handslot when you draw something better, but is not terribly impactful. This is not an important upgrade by any means, but at 1XP this is just good convenience.
Cryptic Research(4xp): Excellent. The only drawback here is the 4XP cost. The effect is insanely good. Drawing 3 cards without even spending an action is a huge deal and being able to spread it around to your more clumsy teammates (like that guardian that has not been able to draw a weapon for four turns) can be even bigger. Once your card pool gets fuller you will find it harder and harder to pay 4XP for this card, but this is going to be great for a good while.
Encyclopedia(2xp): Okay. The important part here is that the +2 skill value persists through the whole phase. So you can spend 1 action to give +2 to all three of your teammates fight actions, for example. If all you are doing is spending an action to enhance one other action, this is not worth it, but if you can set up the more valuable scenario often enough, this can do some good things.
Seeking Answers(2xp): Okay. A card for a clue. Requires a test, doesn’t enhance this test, costs a resource. No huge requirements and can potentially grab a clue from a more difficult location. This is only slightly better than Working a Hunch or Evidence (if it even is better), so having to pay 2XP for it is very unattractive.
Old Book of Lore(3xp): Excellent. An great card to have in play, as it’s of course the OBoL, but better. It’s one cheaper (the difference between 3 cost and 2 cost is so much bigger in practice than one would think) and it offers another two discounts and two bonus actions through its secrets. That’s huge value on top of a card that was already great. The only thing that stops the upgrade from being a staple is that for the most part the level 0 is good enough already and i would rather put the 3XP towards other cards that are in more dire need of upgrading.
Grisly Totem(0xp): Good. Effectively +1 to a test per turn, as long as you commit something. That’s decent, but held back by its cost and taking up a valuable equipment slot.
Grisly Totem(3xp, Seeker): Excellent. Adding card draw makes the card a whole lot better. This is really good value and competitive with many other options.
Death-XIII(1xp): Excellent to Staple. Everything said about the Guardian tarot applies here as well. Intellect is a skill that is usually stacked as high as possible, so any additional source is welcome. 
Scroll of Secrets(0xp): Okay to Bad. For 4 actions, this lets you draw 3 cards which just doesn’t cut it even with the additional options on this. Scroll has some applications to get rid of weaknesses, but just playing Scroll and rolling the dice on that is not worth doing.
Scroll of Secrets(3xp, Seeker): Okay. The ability to look at 3 cards and pick one make it a lot better at attempting to defuse your weakness. Still not all that efficient.
Esoteric Atlas(1xp): Okay. Equals to a net gain of 3 actions if you end up using all of the secrets. That is fine. Allows “skipping” over locations without having to engage enemies there or triggering possible location abilities, which is sometimes worth doing.
Fingerprint Kit: Good to Excellent. It’s a box containing 3 Deductions. That’s not bad, even if it’s expensive and requires an extra action to play. Basically comparable to clue spells in Mystics, but Seekers often have other things that do a similar job for fewer resources. Gets a lot better if you are able to refill the charges.
Hawk-Eye Folding Camera: Excellent. If you care about the willpower, this is a great alternative to the Magnifying Glass. It does cost more to play and isn’t Fast, so this willpower does come at a cost, though.
Mr Rook: Staple. Three free tutors on a reasonable body. That’s ridiculous. That drawback isn’t even a drawback, it’s another ability that lets you basically draw an extra card. Mr. Rook is one of the best Seeker cards ever printed.
Studious: Excellent to Staple. It’s hard to imagine a deck that doesn’t want this. The only question is if they have the XP, but beyond that this doesn’t cost anything at all and is really good. This is more than just an extra card drawn. Especially if you are looking for certain cards in your start hand (like tarots or key deck pieces) then this has a huge effect on how well you can mulligan for it.
Occult Lexicon: Staple. A way for Seeker to deal testless damage while simultanously digging through the deck, this is one of the best ways to occupy one of your hand slots. This is one of those few cards where I require a good reason *not* to play it.
Connect the Dots: Okay. Of course the resource cost is a bit of a bear, but this is a great effect that is worth setting up. As a seeker, you will outgrow this card very quickly though as there are just too many alternative ways to pick up clues that don’t eat up 4 of your resources.
Crack the Case: Staple. One of the best resource cards in the game. Rewards you for doing your thing and it’s easy to get 4+ resources with it. That being said, it’s often worth triggering it for 2, since it’s free. Oh, and you can hand the resources over to someone else.
Ghastly Revelation: Okay to Bad. This card is more of a meme than anything. I will grant that finding 3 clues is good, but planning to die for them is a bit much.
Glimpse the Unthinkable(5xp): Good. The mother of all card draw, this brings you from zero to hero in 1 action. Especially good in big hand decks to immediately enable everything and to draw even higher than 8 cards. Obviously 5XP is a big ask for this though.
Knowledge is Power: Excellent. Oh boy, this card. There are so many overpowered interactions with this, it’s worth its own article. “Ignore all costs” is the phrase that turns this card from a neat flexible card into a powerhouse.
Curiosity: Okay. It’s a nice card if you can fulfill the big hand criteria, but often feels a bit too inconsistent to rely on. Does good work on a small collection but gets crowded out with more options available.

## Mystic

Forbidden Knowledge: Okay to Good. Taking 4 horror for 4 resources is a steep cost, but if you are able to turn this drawback into something you want you can get great value out of Forbidden Knowledge. Agnes is of course one of the investigators that can use this incredibly well, triggering her damage ability on demand.
Holy Rosary: Staple. Willpower is love, willpower is life. Mystics are tied heavily into that skill and will often stack it as much as they can. Even in a full card pool, this is the best way of adding +1 will to your accessory slot. The 2 sanity soak it offers are also quite valuable.
Shrivelling: Staple. If you sometimes consider vanilla ice to be too spicy, i have the perfect card for you! The default fighting spell and the template for several others to follow in later expansions. Has a good bunch of charges for its cost, deals unconditional +damage and allows using your strongest attribute. Agnes even turns the drawback into an upside, allowing her to sometimes deal 3 damage in one attack. This allows wizards to cast “gun”.
Arcane Initiate: Staple. When most of your deck is made up from Spells, Initiate almost just straight up draws a card each turn. She even tanks a horror for you. And all that for the low cost of a measly resource. The doom she enters play with means that you will want to get rid of her before the agenda advances or you will want to wait playing her until the “Witching Hour”, when the agenda would’ve advanced anyways.
Scrying: Bad. Doesn’t really do a whole lot. Reordering the encounter deck can be okay in solo play, but solo play doesn’t afford you the actions to first play this card, then use it a couple of times without advancing the board state.
Arcane Studies: Okay. Like guardians, mystics usually don’t have many spare resources to spend on stuff like this. That being said, this does boost willpower.
Blinding Light: Bad. It’s like a much more limited version of Mind over Matter, allowing for an emergency evade with your best attribute. Unlike the surprisingly flexible seeker event, this one is rather costly and comes with a significant drawback. The kind of drawback you REALLY don’t want to see on an enemy control spell.
Drawn to the Flame: Staple. Remember all that talk about a card for a clue? This takes an action, but gives two clues for your card. No test. No conditions. No resources. It just works. Well, you might have to contest with whatever you draw from the top of the encounter deck, but honestly, mystics are pretty good at that.
Ward of Protection: Staple. If whatever you draw from the encounter deck (no matter if its during the mythos phase or from your Drawn to the Flame) is bad enough, you can just say No to it and it goes away. Costs a horror, but if it stops am Ancient Evils or a Grasping Hands, that’s easily worth it. Note that this only works on cards you draw yourself and not on enemy cards. Counterspells for those exist (and they are actually also called Ward of Protection…), but not in the Core.
Blinding Light(2xp): Okay. A significant upgrade. Reducing the cost and increasing the damage turns a rather rotten evasion card into something that actually deals decent damage on top of the evade. The possibility of losing an action to it is still a massive turnoff, though.
Fearless: Good. With all the horror we are taking from our own cards, having some heal available isn’t half bad. Fearless only provides a single icon in addition which makes it a bit questionable value for a full card, but this is at least playable.
Mind Wipe(1xp): Okay to Good. Has some fancy uses, although those are probably not going to come up often enough during the Core scenarios. Crucially, it doesn’t work to remove Retaliate from an Elite like the Ghoul-Priest. This is a tech card that you use because you have something specific in mind that you want to adress, a card that only gains value once you possess some intimate knowledge of campaign contents that you want to prepare for in advance.
Book of Shadows(3xp): Bad. Trading a hand for an arcane slot is usually not what you want to do, especially not in the Core where you barely have enough assets to even take up those slots. Most certainly you don’t want to spend 4 resources on it either. The book also has an ability to refill charges, but an action per charge is an outlandish ask. This is one of the few cards in the game that is just straight up unusable.
Grotesque Statue(4xp): Excellent. This offers greatly increased chances to pass four tests of your choice for 2 resources. That’s a very good rate and you can even do some fancy things with it being an Item asset to recur it once its spent. 4XP is a lot, but this is indeed very impactful.
Rite of Seeking: Excellent to Staple. Not quite the evergreen staple that Shrivelling is due to that drawback of potentially ending your turn. Even if you play around it by only using it on your last action, this does require some concessions to make it work without much risk. That +2 skill value is a godsend however and getting additional clues with each charge is very important. You might outgrow this card once you have alternatives, but that doesn’t take away from Rite of Seeking being quite good for just 2XP.
Scrying(3xp): Okay to Bad. This however…. So, Scrying 3 at least fixes Scrying’s biggest problem, that action cost on its activation. That does give it some legs in solo play. Outside of that, the impact is just not worth 3XP though. And that it gains an extra drawback is completely uncalled for.
Enchanted Blade(0xp): Good. Using the fight skill in combat isn’t something that most mystics are interested in, but for the few that do, Enchanted Blade does offer a crucial +2 to their tests.
Enchanted Blade(3xp, Mystic): Good to Excellent. Those mystics will need all the help they can get and the upgraded blade allows attacking with +4 and for 3 damage twice. Pretty good and even after the charges are used up, having a +2 weapon around isn’t completely worthless.
Four of Cups(1xp): Staple. Mystics are married to their primary attribute even more than Guardians and Seekers. Every point counts.
Scroll of Secrets(0xp): Okay to Bad. See above.
Scroll of Secrets(3xp, Mystic): Bad. This upgrade barely adds more than an extra activation. Looking at the top of your deck with this is only relevant if you know what’s there.
Dayana Esperence(3xp): Excellent. All around great. Gives two additional uses of a spell and offers a chunk of damage soak while doing it. Even has good icons. There’s simply a lot to like here which makes up for being expensive to buy and to play.
Sixth Sense(0xp): Staple. Even if this didn’t have any textbox beyond “-> : Investigate”, this would be worth playing. Allowing mystics to use their willpower for clues without any sort of charges is a huge deal.
Sixth Sense(4xp): Staple. In addition to doing the willpower thing, this allows mystics to pick up 2 clues with one action often enough to make this upgrade fantastic. Once you start improving your odds with bag manipulation, this just takes off completely.
De Vermis Mysteriis(2xp): Good. It’s a powerful effect, but usually you will want to get rid of the card before it prematurely advances the agenda. The trick then is getting enough value out of it in the meantime.
Wither(0xp): Okay. Like Sixth Sense, this allows a mystic access to a basic action with willpower. Unlike investigation, an attack for 1 is usually not worth the action though. The extra ability does little to nothing. Still, if you got rats and cultists to kill, this could be worth throwing into your starting deck.
Wither(4xp): Bad to Okay. There’s really no excuse for this still not getting an extra damage. The ability can now deal a “temporary damage”, but it’s way too unreliable to throw 4XP at this when better options exist. That being said, with TCU+Core, better options might not exist…
Sign Magick: Okay. Any card that swaps around slots can be worth considering, but this is just a bit too expensive at 3 resources. Mystics need their money to play the spells that go into those slots, making Sign Magick hard to justify most of the time.
Deny Existence(0xp): Staple. Saying no to something the encounter deck tries to do to you is among the most powerful things you can do and Deny Existence is a very broad effect that can even help you against several weakness cards.
Deny Existence(5xp): Excellent. For when you really want to dunk on the encounter deck. This card is just insane, not only cancelling a harmful effect but also giving you the means to just take another copy of that effect on the chin. Due to how expensive it is, it’s really only a luxury upgrade for the final stretch of a campaign though.
Banish(1xp): Good to Excellent. A highly underrated card that can effectively take out non-Elites in one go. Even Hunters can be transported to the other side of the map. Or right on top of your enemy handler. Not a card that is talked about often, but personally I like it quite a bit.
Eldritch Inspiration: Okay to Bad. A narrow card that usually doesn’t do enough – and whenever it would be able to do something, it’s too unreliable. Mostly notable as a cheap cancel for Diana to play at the first opportunity just to raise her willpower.
Prophesy: Okay to Good. Get massively outpaced on a larger card pool, but this does a decent job of being multiple wild icons on a skill for a while.

## Neutral

Knife: Okay to Bad. Look at it as a damage event. You can use it once to deal 2 damage to something. And that’s fine until you have better cards. Fine. Not great. Just fine. It does it’s job. Barely.
Flashlight: Staple. You’ll never really stop playing Flashlight, as it’s just a very efficient way of giving some clue capabilities to investigators that aren’t great at it otherwise. The trick is that reducing a 2 shroud location to 0 shroud means that you can only fail on the tentacle, no matter how bad your intellect is. Even without that interaction, three charges of +2 skill is super solid.
Emergency Cache: Staple. This is the gold standard that other resource cards have to measure against. Not really much to say about this one. You need resources to play your cards. Even a deck with a low curve will want some extra cash to set up its assets quickly in the first couple turns.
Guts, Perception, Overpower, Staples. Alright, so these four skills are all staples and generally referred to as “The Core Skills”. That should tell you something about their importance already! They enhance a test and they do so without costing a card, an action or resource. That is just very good value. Your deck will want a certain amount of skills because you usually don’t have enough resources and actions to play everything anyways. As long as you have a solid base skill, playing the accompanying core skill card is pretty much never wrong. I usually don’t run these if my base skill value is low. Passing a test with skill 1 isn’t going to happen, but at skill 3 it still isn’t likely enough. The best value is probably going from skill 3 or 4 to skill 5 or 6 with these as it turns a test that was risky into a relatively sure thing.
Guts, Manual Dexterity: The willpower and the agility skill are the two exceptions to what i said above about not taking them when I am low in a skill. These are still worth considering because they are the two skills that the encounter deck tests you on regularly. Especially when facing treacheries with scaling effects like Rotting Remains a Guts can help you even you fail because it can be the difference between taking 3 horror and taking 1 horror. Some of it is also born out of necessity. Committing both a Guts and an Unexpected Courage into one test might just be the only chance for Skids to shake off a Frozen in Fear.
Unexpected Courage: Staple. A bit of a different beast than the other four Core Skills in that it doesn’t replace itself, but it can commit to any skill test. That sort of flexibility is valuable. I rate this one a notch below the other four because i just really want that card draw. But it’s hard to argue against Unexpected Courage because it’s just always relevant.
Bulletproof Vest(3xp): Good to Excellent. Are you sick of having Daisy die whenever an enemy sneezes her way? This will help. It costs a chunk of XP, but at 2 resources for 4 health it is very affordable in terms of resources and puts Daisy’s health reserves on the same level as Roland’s. This is a good pickup if you got some trauma during a campaign and feel the need to address that in a way that doesn’t set you back a bunch of actions.
Elder Sign Amulet(3xp): Good. This is a similar deal to the Bulletproof Vest, with the same sort of situations leading one to want it. Roland starts on 5 sanity and has a weakness that can deal mental trauma to him. An Elder Sign Amulet can give him the necessary buffer to not go insane. The amulet does take up the accessory slot though, and that is a much more important and valuable slot than the body slot taken up by the Vest. As a result, the Amulet sees a lot less play. On the other hand, this is not much of a concern in the Core Set. And sometimes you just gotta do what you gotta do when trauma stacks up.
Emergency Cache(2xp): Okay. Let me just copy/paste my comment on Lucky(2) because it’s the exact same thing here: Not exactly an exciting upgrade. Doesn’t improve the primary effect of the card in any way, it simply tacks a “Draw a card” onto the textbox in exchange for 2XP. It’s not awful, but we can do so much better.
Charisma(3xp): Staple. Ally assets are among the most impactful things that we can play. Consider that an ally not only has some ability, but also soaks damage and horror for us and you might even consider Charisma as a viable alternative to Bulletproof Vest, Elder Sign Amulet or indeed both. The use of allies is mostly limited through two factors: They tend to cost a bunch of resources and they use up an ally slot. Charisma solves one half of that equation. And it does so on a Permanent card, meaning you have no variance with it, it’s always in play. Charisma is a very powerful enabler for lots of shenanigans or just straight up good value.
Relic Hunter(3xp): Staple. Doesn’t have quite the significance that Charisma has, but as the game releases more and more things that take up the accessory slot, it’s getting there. Accessories are usually high impact assets and being able to use multiple different ones (or two of the same in some cases!) can be very potent. Unlike Charisma, Relic Hunter usually doesn’t provide extra damage and horror soak except in some exceptions… accessories with soak do exist, the Holy Rosary in the Core for example. The good news with Relic Hunter in comparison to Charisma is that accessories are often fairly cheap, so wanting to fill additional accessory slots doesn’t strain the resource situation as much as it does for allies.

Ace of Rods(1xp): Bad. A card so marginal, the TCU campaign hands out one of these for free at the start and players usually treat it like a weakness because it just costs a draw and doesn’t do much.
Anna Kaslow(4xp): Okay. Too fragile to be counted on for shenanigans with multiple tarots. Can be treated as extra copies of a tarot that you REALLY want to get in your start hand, but of course at 4XP that’s a bit rough.
The Council’s Coffer(2xp): Meme. Requires a million actions. The payoff is nice, but this is not something to play because it’s good, this is a “because i can” thing.
