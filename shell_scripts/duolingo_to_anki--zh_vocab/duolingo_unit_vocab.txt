TIP
Talking about dates
To say a complete date in Chinese, start with the year, followed by the month, and then the day of the week. For November 30, 2011 you'd begin with the year:
二〇一一年
(èr líng yī yī nián) 2011
Then add the month:
十一月
(shíyīyuè) November
And the day:
三十号
(sānshí hào) 30th
Put it all together and November 30, 2011 is 二〇一一年十一月三十号!


To say Monday, December 1 you'd start with the month:
十二月一号
shí'èryuè yī hào
Then add the day of the week:
星期一

KEY PHRASES
Call someone on the phone

Hello? Are you Doctor Li?
请慢一点儿。
Slow down, please.
你明白吗？
Do you understand?
我不明白。
I don't understand.
你说得很快！
You speak very fast!
TIP
得 (de) to describe actions
In English, when we say He eats slowly, the word slowly describes how he eats. To describe an action in Chinese, add 得
 (de) plus an adjective
 right after the verb
. And don’t forget that most adjectives require 很
 (hěn).
你说得很快。
(Nǐ shuō de hěn kuài.) You speak quickly.
我吃得很慢。
(Wǒ chī de hěn màn.) I eat slowly.
他说得很好。
(Tā shuō de hěn hǎo.) He speaks well. 
KEY PHRASES
Describe people
他高吗？
Is he tall?

Is your younger brother short?
那是我们的朋友。
That is our friend.
TIP
Asking questions
You already know how to ask questions by saying 不
 (bù, not) after the verb
 and then repeating the verb again; for example, 那是不是你的妻子？
 This works with adjectives
, too! 

Also, notice that in this pattern, 很
 (hěn) is no longer used.
你
高兴
不
高兴
？
(Nǐ gāoxìng bu gāoxìng?) Are you happy?
他
忙
不
忙
？
(Tā máng bu máng?) Is he busy?
TIP
Verily!
Remember that 很
 (hěn) is usually used before adjectives
, even when it doesn’t actually mean very (for example, 我很高兴。
 However, in questions ending with 吗
 (ma), speakers are less likely to use 很
.
她们忙吗？
(Tāmen máng ma?) Are they busy?
In fact, if a speaker does add 很
 to a question with 吗
, it’s likely that 很
 means very.
她们很忙吗？
(Tāmen hěn máng ma?) Are they very busy?

TIP
The past is in the past
One use of 了
 (le) is to show that you have finished doing something. In other words, 了
 is a way you can talk about the past in Chinese! For example, while in English, we might say I ate or She went, in Chinese, you’ll hear 我
吃了
 (wǒ chīle, I ate) or 她
去了
 (tā qùle, She went) instead.

Measure words
You’ve already seen the measure word
 个
 (ge) between a number and a noun
 (for example, 三个学生)
 or after words like this or that (for example, 这个孩子
 or 那个人)
.

You also need to use a measure word after 上
 (shàng, last), 下
 (xià, next) and 每
 (měi, every). 
上个星期
(shàng ge xīngqī) last week
下个月
(xià ge yuè) next month
